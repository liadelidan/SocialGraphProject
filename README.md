# SocialGraphProject

The is the last assigment for the course Software Engineering

What I did is I connected to GitHub and created a graphical way to show each project a user has and how many commits did he make in it.
Each central dot in a graph is a repository of a specific user, and the dots surround it are the commits he made.

I gave my user "liadelidan" as an example in the code, but it can work on any public github user.

To run it, download all the files, simply create an http server on the local machine and run the html script provided.
