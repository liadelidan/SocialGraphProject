# SocialGraphProject

The is the last assigment for the course Software Engineering

What I did is I connected to GitHub and created a graphical way to show each project a user has and how many commits did he make in it.
Each central dot in a graph is a repository of a specific user, and the dots surround it are the commits he made.
